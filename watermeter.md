# WML Watermeter
Each year my watermeter needs to be manually checked. The current reading needs to be reported to the provider in order to send me the yearly bill. This process is time consuming and exhausting to do. About time to fix this and make the dumb meter smart. Of course I could have installed a flow meter, but what's the fun of that..
