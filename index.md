# Welcome
A warm welcome on my new Domotica blog-ish site. My goal is to write small guides / showcase tutorials for the projects I did in my house.
All of them are smart house related and of course all have passed the WAF (Wife Acceptance Factor).
Special thanks to [Joep Verhaeg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joepverhaeg/) for the last push in starting this site.

# Projects
